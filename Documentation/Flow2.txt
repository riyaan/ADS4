Starting cell
	Choose random direction (N, S, W, E)
	N (x, y+1)
	S (x, y-1)
	W (x+1, y)
	E (x-1, y)
	check if the cell at this position(direction) exists
	If there is a cell on the other side (this is not a wall) Then
		Get the cell status
		If cell in this direction has not been visited Then
			Break down direction wall of previous cell and current cell (Cell will have 4 walls, mark the relevant wall as "Down")
			previousCell.Direction.BreakWall
			currentCell.Direction.Opposite.BreakWall	
			Move to cell
			Mark current cell as visited
			The cell that was entered, has to know from which direction it was entered.
